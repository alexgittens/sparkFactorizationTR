Latest Todo, after SC feedback (incorporate ALL prior feedback from ALL submissions: SC, IPDPS, Sigmod, Pasc, retreat presentation and poster session)
------------------

- Related Works section - Comment on NERSC Magellan Report, Sparrow, Sparkler, Kira, Drineas parallel Blendenpik, Network Perf. on EC2 (INFOCOMM2010), Making Sense of Perf. in Data Analytics (NSDI15), MADlib and MAD Skills papers.

- Cite all of the above (however, unsure how parallel Blendenpik fits as we’re not talking about algorithm innovation for Spark).

- Extend Straggler problem subsection as many reviewers had questions and concerns about the plots.

- More on Spark/MPI implementation. Comment on YARN, Mesos, etc.

- Shorten/omit science results section (see review 3).

- Additional plots/alternative plots — Show non-stacked bars for better comparison with MPI v. Spark (especially relevant for NMF data), remove HDF5 times and show scalability of just algorithm, and plot with Spark overheads removed. Some asked about going to larger scale but is that feasible.

- More explanation of the phenomena observed in the plots. E.g., issues that may be due to H5Spark should be addressed (these were asked about at the retreat), as should concerns about why there is still a multiple times gap between Spark and MPI even when overheads are removed (also asked about at the retreat)

- More explanation on Spark setup (see review 4).

- Legibility of figures in print.

- Descriptions for tables and figures.

Paper ToDo
(aim to get everything in place by 3pm for Prabhat to make complete pass)

Sunday
------
Michael:
- add refs to Scalapack, Lapack, etc. in the introduction
- check correctness of methods section, completeness of references
- read paper from start to finish, checking grammar, usage and any obvious errors

Lisa:
- rearrange so figure 1 is closer to the dataset discussion
- read paper from finish to start, checking grammar, usage and any obvious errors

Alex: 
- add refs to C+MPI implementations in methods section
- add paragraph for 2.2TB discussion
- add paragraph for CX science (3-4 lines)
- figure out what is going on with reference (this is an IEEE class issue, it looks like)

Jey:
- check Section IV-A

Aditya:
- insert sentence in conclusion relating to limitations of Spark JVM, etc, so link to optimized libraries for on node computations and  future work, I believe, to interface Spark w/ MPI codes 

Evan:
- check we're not over counting IO on the 100 node NMF Spark run
- fix the spacing of the rightmost spark label (on x-axis) in Figure 5
- increase line thickness in Figures 6 and 7
- change/remove the titles for Figure 6 and 7 (e.g. don't need to know stage and executor numbers)
- Fix VII-B
- Fix "" to `` '' when quoting

Adi, Evan:
- compress VII

Prabhat:
- change tone of conclusion to be more positive towards Spark
- shorten the paper to the 10 page limit

Intro of Spark — Alex will consult with Jey/Lisa

CX we’ll include Spark scaling data at most, running time breakdown at 30 (or 60), 100 and 300 — Evan/Lisa

Add figure labels and captions for Spark plots, make sure plot colors are consistent— Evan

Make sure plots are close to/before text in which they are referenced— Aditya

Science interpretation — Prabhat will take a look

“Triangle plots” which show scheduler delay — Evan will iterate

Conclusion, Cite KIRA SE paper and say two sentences — Aditya, Alex, Prabhat
