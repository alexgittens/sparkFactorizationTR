Paper ToDo
(aim to get everything in place by 3pm for Prabhat to make complete pass)

Sunday
------
Michael:
- add refs to Scalapack, Lapack, etc. in the introduction
- check correctness of methods section, completeness of references
- read paper from start to finish, checking grammar, usage and any obvious errors

Lisa:
- rearrange so figure 1 is closer to the dataset discussion
- read paper from finish to start, checking grammar, usage and any obvious errors

Alex: 
- add refs to C+MPI implementations in methods section
- add paragraph for 2.2TB discussion
- add paragraph for CX science (3-4 lines)
- figure out what is going on with reference (this is an IEEE class issue, it looks like)

Jey:
- check Section IV-A

Aditya:
- insert sentence in conclusion relating to limitations of Spark JVM, etc, so link to optimized libraries for on node computations and  future work, I believe, to interface Spark w/ MPI codes 

Evan:
- check we're not over counting IO on the 100 node NMF Spark run
- fix the spacing of the rightmost spark label (on x-axis) in Figure 5
- increase line thickness in Figures 6 and 7
- change/remove the titles for Figure 6 and 7 (e.g. don't need to know stage and executor numbers)
- Fix VII-B
- Fix "" to `` '' when quoting

Adi, Evan:
- compress VII

Prabhat:
- change tone of conclusion to be more positive towards Spark
- shorten the paper to the 10 page limit

Intro of Spark — Alex will consult with Jey/Lisa

CX we’ll include Spark scaling data at most, running time breakdown at 30 (or 60), 100 and 300 — Evan/Lisa

Add figure labels and captions for Spark plots, make sure plot colors are consistent— Evan

Make sure plots are close to/before text in which they are referenced— Aditya

Science interpretation — Prabhat will take a look

“Triangle plots” which show scheduler delay — Evan will iterate

Conclusion, Cite KIRA SE paper and say two sentences — Aditya, Alex, Prabhat
